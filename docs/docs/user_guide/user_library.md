# Contributing Definitions to a User Library
One of the primary contributions a User Library type plugin would provide to AaC are definitions to be exposed to the AaC space. Definitions are a key concept and functionality within AaC, so for maximized integration and utilization for a new plugin its definitions need to be exposed to AaC. 

To do so a plugin will include its definitions as part of its registration with AaC. For registering a plugin, see [Plugins](./old/Plugins) and [Plugin Developer Guide](../dev_guide/plugin_dev_guide)
